We also offer FREE access to analog and/or mixed-signals integrated circuits Hspice netlists to help you in simulating and/or in evaluating your microsystems. 

Most subcircuits made available by Synapse IC have been simulated and/or tested by our experienced IC design engineers. Synapse IC team wants you to achieve your goal. So any individual and/or company with special request can contact us and we will be glad to help you. We currently, offer the following netlists of cells design in TSMC 0.18 Î¼m CMOS process:

* A 1 V 8-bit 250 ksps successive approximation ADC
* A 0.6-V 57.5-fJ/Conversion-Step 250-kS/s 8-bit Rail-to-Rail Successive Approximation ADC.
* 10-bit segmented R-2R DAC 
* 1.8 V 8-bit Rail-to-rail analog comparator 
* A 0.5 V rail-to-rail input CMOS Analog Switch 
* One clock-phase D-FF
