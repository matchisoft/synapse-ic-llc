We have a broad range of experience in areas including: 

* analog integrated circuit design (bandgaps, voltage regulators, opamps);
* digital integrated circuit design (standard cells librairies)
* mixed signal integrated circuit design (ADCs, DACs, timers)
* development of systems for sensing (temperature, light and capacitive sensors)


The engineersâ€™ team at Synapse IC work in close partnership with experienced IC designers in academia and industry to be able to serve you with a wide range of services. Synapse IC will keep a strong link with the University where we can do our research together with Master and Ph.D students and the scientific staff members. Besides, we have access to a well-equipped university lab for IC evaluation.
