# Services that grow with your business

Our goal is to use our expertise for customer specific design services, covering the entire range from feasibility studies and design.
Based on our long history in industrial integrated circuits (IC) design and research we are able to design robust ICs with short design cycles and high-quality levels for consumer electronics. Our recent work has been focused in the areas of circuit development for low voltage integrated circuits, electronic sensors, as well as printed sensors on flexible substrates.
